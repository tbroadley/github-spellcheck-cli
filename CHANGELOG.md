## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the spell checking was skipped after 30 found misspell errors, even if they are matched by one of `--ignore` patterns.

## [3.0.2] - 2017-04-14

### Fixed

- Updated [`retext-indefinite-article`](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-indefinite-article) to 1.1.3 in order to properly expect "a" in front of words like "1-to-1" and "1:00".
- Added a `--ignore` option. This option takes a list of regexes. Spelling mistakes that match any of the regexes, after wrapping each regex in `^` and `$`, will be ignored.

## [3.0.1] - 2017-12-30

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where messages of type `overflow` generated by `retext-spell` were included in the generated dictionary, causing "undefined" to be added to the end of the dictionary.

## [3.0.0] - 2017-12-29

### Added

- Log a count of the files to be spellchecked.
- Add a large number of unit and end-to-end tests.
- Add development instructions to [README.md](./README.md).

  - [`retext-syntax-mentions`](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-syntax-mentions)
  - [`retext-syntax-urls`](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-syntax-urls)
- Apply all of the above plugins, as well as [`retext-spell`](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-spell), by default.
